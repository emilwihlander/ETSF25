\section{Introduction}
Autonomous cars (i. e. self-driving cars) is right around the corner whether we like it or not. Will it revolutionize the world or not? Who knows, what we do know is that the development had to start somewhere. One piece of the puzzle is to make the car have a automatic brake system. In reality, a car will automatically brake if there is an object (e. g. cyclist, fallen tree, pedestrian) in front of the vehicle to prevent accidents. 

Let's take an example. Imagine that you are driving in the suburbs when suddenly a child accidentally kicks a ball onto the streets. The kid make a run for the ball, not aware of it's surroundings. You hit the brakes as hard as you possibly can, but it's too late. The kid heavily injured. Now picture the same scenario with a automatic brake system. The car would this time be able to stop, by itself, in time and the kid is not harmed.

Mankind is constantly trying to invent devices or systems that are able to the remove the most hazardous factor, human error. Automatic braking is an example of that.
